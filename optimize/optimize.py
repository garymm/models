#  Call one2many on the command line

# Python program starts
# âœ… Python calls go model with a --hypers cmd arg, which tells it to do nothing except print out its hyperparameter specificiations
# Python reads that file to get hypers, then converts into a format that optuna can use
# Python writes params to file
# Python calls the go model with a cmdline arg telling it to run without gui, and telling it where to find params
# Go model computes a single eval metric and writes it to file
# When go model finishes, python reads output from file, getting objective metric
# Python iterates
